If you found any errors in the documentation, have ideas/suggestions for improvements, or if you made some modifications, please let us know (you can edit this document with the tracking function and send it to us).\nKnown Issues\n\nThe cable chain holder on the z-axis needs some redesign. The current version needs to be manually adjusted.\n\nImprovements\n\nLimit switch holder files exist in Sketchup only; an adaptation to FreeCAD is desirable.\nThe y-axis motor could be rotated

If you found any errors in the documentation, have ideas/suggestions for improvements, or if you made some modifications, please let us know (you can edit this document with the tracking function and send it to us).\nKnown Issues\n\nThe cable chain holder on the z-axis needs some redesign. The current version needs to be manually adjusted.\n\nImprovements\n\nLimit switch holder files exist in Sketchup only; an adaptation to FreeCAD is desirable.\nThe y-axis motor could be rotated 180\u00b0, which would make cabling easier later on.", "breadcrumbs": ["docs/index.md", "docs/Step14.md"]}]
